    <H1>Web Developer - Tom McIntyre</H1>
    
    <p>
        Hi!  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist 
      <a herf ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's
      not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it
      would be cool if there were.

    <h4>Tom McIntyre</h4>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.

    <h4>Lee Donahoe</h4>
    
    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h4>Nick Merwin</h4>
    
     <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
